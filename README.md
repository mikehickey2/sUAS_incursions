Small Unmanned Arial System (sUAS) Airpace Incursion Data Project

Initiated 9/22/2025

This is an evolving project to gather data from government and commercial databases to analyze data, identify trends, and create reports. This is an exploratory analysis of the data and will continue to evolve as I work through new and different data sources.

9/22/2025 - Created the shell of the project, built a script to pull data from the FAA drone sighting database.  Pulled one file.  Definitely need to improve the script to automate file naming conventions, and to have the newest files pulled into the local machine to create a data frame.  Next steps are to create a data cleaning script and start figuring out what to do with these very simple .xlsx files from the database.  Only four variables are pulled per observation.
